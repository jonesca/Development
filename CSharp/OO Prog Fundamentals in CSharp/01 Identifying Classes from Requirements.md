##Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
1. <i class="highlight">Abstraction</i> (more of concept than a programming technique and is often not considered one of the pillars)
 - The properties that make sense for the requirements of the application
 - Simplify reality
 - Ignore extraneous details
 - Focus on what is important for a purpose
2. <i class="highlight">Encapsulation</i>
 - Technique to hide the data and details in a class to hide complexity
 ###Data Hiding
 - Protects the data
 - Allows for authorization before getting the data
 - Allows for validation before setting the data
 ###Implementation Hiding
 - Helps manage complexity
 - Only the class needs to understand the implementation
 - Implementation can be changed without impacting the application
3. <i class="highlight">Inheritance</i>
4. <i class="highlight">Polymorphism</i>

##OOP
1. Identify Classes
 - Represents business entities (NOUNS of the business requirements)
 - Defines properties (data)
 - Defines methods (actions / behavior)
2. Separate Responsibilities
3. Establish Relationships
4. Leverage Reuse
