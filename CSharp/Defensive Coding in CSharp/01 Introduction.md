#What is defensive coding?
- An approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:
 - <font class="highlight">General Quality</font> - reducing the number of software bugs and problems
 - Making the source code <font class="highlight">comprehensible</font> - the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit
 - Making the software behave in a <font class="highlight">predictable</font> manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions
