# Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns are used to create / construct new objects  

## Constructor Pattern
Used to created new objects with their own object scope - this is similar to creating a new class in dotNet  
Use the <strong>new</strong> keyword to create a brand new object

### Prototype
An encapsulation of properties that an object links to

## Module Pattern
- A simple way to encapsulate a group of like methods
- Creates a "Toolbox" of functions to used
 - Service for certain types of calls for example

## Factory Pattern
- A pattern used to simplify object creation 
- Creating different objects based on need
- Repository Creation

## Singleton Pattern
Used to restrict an object to one instance of that object across the application  
- Remembers the last time you used it 
- Hands the same instance back
