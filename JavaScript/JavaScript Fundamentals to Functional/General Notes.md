An object literal is a comma seperated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.
Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package.  This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.
You use literals to represent values in JavaScript.  These are fixed values, not variables, that you <em>literally</em> provide in your script.  There are several type of literals:
- Array literals
- Boolean literals
- Floating-point literals
- Integers
- Object literals
- RegExp literals
- String literals
