# Do While Loops
Do While loops will always run at least once since the code does not check the condition until after the code has been run through at least one time

```javascript
//do something...while something is true
var x = 1;

do{
    console.log("Hello!");
    x++;
}
while (x === 1);
```

# While Loops
While loops only run the code if the condition holds true.  If the condition is false the code does not get run.

```javascript
//while Loops
var x = 1;

while (x < 2){
    console.log("Hello!");
    x++;
}
```

Do While and While loops are useful when we don't know how many times we need / want our loop to run
