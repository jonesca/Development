## Syntax
A hard break can be created by pressing shift-enter
>Placing a > at the start of a line creates a block > quote
>>Additional >> will next block quotes in block quotes

Wrap a word with a single * or a single _ italicize

Wrap a word with a double ** or double __ to bold

Unorder lists can be created using *, +, or -
* This is an example
+ So is This
- This as well

Ordered lists are created with using 1.
1. This is an example
2. So is this
3. And this

Use 1\. to use a number with period but not create an ordered list:  
1\. This is an example
2. So is this
3. And this

Create an in-line link using Link Text using **\[Link Text\](URL) "This is the title attribute"]**  
Example: [ESPN](http://espn.com "ESPN")

The in-line image value is set the same as the in-line link; however, it is preceded with an exlamation mark (!) and it supports the *title* attribute as well  

You can use reference links and reference images by using a second set of [][Link1/Image1] rather than () then else where in the document (normally at the end or in a references sections) you put a [Link1/Image1]: followed by the URL and "Title Attribute text"  

You can also surround a URL with <> to show a URL  
Example: <http://espn.com>
