# Models in the MVC Framework

- There are a couple different types of models that can be used in an MVC application.
- _Models_ can be thought of as entities we want saved in the database
- _ViewModels_ are dedicated to a specific view

## View Model

- _Entity Model_ it is a model of the data in the database containing the same information as the database does
- _View Model_ is an object used to carry information between a view and a controller containing everything a view will need to render html.  This is also known as a **Data Transfer Object (DTO)** because the view model carries information around.
