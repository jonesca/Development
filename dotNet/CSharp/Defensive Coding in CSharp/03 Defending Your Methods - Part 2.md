#Defending Your Methods - Part 2
- <b>Guard Clauses</b> ensure methods receive valid input
- Minimize parameter quantity
- Use consistent parameter ordering

##Design by Contract
1. What does a method expect?
 - What are the acceptable and unacceptable inputs?
2. What does a method guarantee?
 - What is the expected return value or expected error / exceptions
3. What does the method maintain?
 - Defining any properties used or set by the method
