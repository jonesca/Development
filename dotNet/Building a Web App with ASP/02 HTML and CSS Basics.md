# HTML and CSS Basics

## HTML Basics
- The **html** tag starts and ends each html document.  Everything goes inside this tag
- The first child of the *html* tag is normal the **head** tag.  Non structural information is kept in the head like metadata
 - Title goes in here
 - The encoding (character set) should go in here.
- The **body** tag is the descriptive structure of the page
- The **p** tag is a paragraph tag
- A **span** is an inline section of code.  **P**aragraphs are always blocks of code; **spans** are always smaller sections of code.
- Shift-Alt-W (comes from the Web Essentials extension) wraps the selected code in a **div** tag
- A **div** tag is structure or container for some part of the page

- entering an & brings up intellisense for entities like copyright

- **ul** is an unordered list
- **ol** is an ordered list or numbered list
- **li** is a list item and is part of both types of lists


## HTML Forms
To collect something from the user we need to use something like HTML Forms
- The **form** tag is where the form structure is held
- Inside the *form* element will be the different controls you want to use
 - **label** is a label for other controls on the form
 - **input** creates a place for the user to enter data
 - The *input* type has an attribute call submit
- One way to display the elements of the form in a colum rather than a row is to surrount each in a *div* element

## CSS Basics
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the design of the page.  Separating Structure from Design is a Best Practice  
You can style in Style Tags, Style Blocks, and Stylesheets
- A **Style tag** is a tag above the *body* tag to provide styles for tags / elements on that page
