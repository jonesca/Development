# Semantic HTML

## Auditing our Project for Semanticism
- What is the element's intended purpose?
- What are we describing?
- Is there a more descriptive element we could use?
- Are elements used presentationally?

<strong>Our HTML is building an outline used by search engines and assistive technologies</strong>

`<strong>` Represents text that has strong importance; it should not be used just to create bold text.  Style sheets should be used for styling and presentation.
