# HTML Path on Pluralsight

**DOM** = Document Object Model.  This is essential all the elements and content that make up the page.

## When to use DIV and SECTION tags in HTML

"The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline."

This is taken directly from the w3c documentation here: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html

Divs have no meaning in and of themselves and generally are only used for styling purposes as indicated above. We use sections to give our document meaning for screen-readers and search engines.

Ctl-D duplicates the element (in brackets at least).
